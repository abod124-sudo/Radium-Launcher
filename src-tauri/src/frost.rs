//! part of the screen it is about to cover is captured, shrunk and blurred,
//! and handed to the page as an image to paint behind its content. The page
//! draws the rounded corners itself, anti-aliased, so there is one clean edge.
//! The snapshot doesn't follow what moves behind the window afterwards, which
