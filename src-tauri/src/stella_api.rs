//! Stella's live game API — rooms, people and profiles — reached the way the
//! game client reaches it.
//!
//! Stella runs the stock Rec Room backend behind Cloudflare, its services
//! (auth, accounts, rooms, matchmaking, the rest) on hosts named by the name
//! server at `api.stellaonline.org/` — see [`url`]. Three things, and only these three, get a request
//! through and answered (measured against the real client, 2026-10-01):
//!
//! 1. **`User-Agent: BestHTTP`.** Cloudflare's rule is purely on this string —
//!    the game's HTTP library. Anything else is a 403 block page before the
//!    origin is even reached (`/download/*` is the one open exception, which is
//!    why the installer in `stella.rs` uses a different User-Agent). The whole
//!    "we can't read Stella" story up to now was this one header.
//! 2. **A bearer token**, from [`login`]: the game signs in with a Steam
//!    auth-session ticket, and so does this. No ticket, 401.
//! 3. For a handful of write paths, an `X-RNSIG` request signature — which none
//!    of the read endpoints here need, so it is not implemented.
//!
//! The Stella developers run this same access for their own Discord bot and
//! asked us to use it; it is a community revival of a shut-down game, read with
//! the player's own account. Everything below is read-only: room and people
//! listings and public profiles, reshaped into the exact envelope the frontend
//! already consumes for Radium and Vanilla (`{ Results, TotalResults }`, with
//! absolute `ThumbUrl` / `AvatarUrl`), so `loadRooms()` / `loadPeople()` do not
//! care which network answered.
//!
//! ## Auth, and why there is no refresh
//!
//! `POST /auth/connect/token` with `grant_type=cached_login` takes the Steam
//! ticket and returns an access token (a JWT) and a refresh token. The refresh
//! grant answers 500 on this server, so this does not use it: when the access
//! token nears its `exp`, [`ensure_session`] simply signs in again with a fresh
//! ticket. A sign-in needs Steam running and the account owning Rec Room
//! (AppId 471710); when it isn't, the tabs show that rather than an error.
