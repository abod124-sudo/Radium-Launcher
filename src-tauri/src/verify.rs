//! "Verify game files": check the installed client against what was
//! installed, and repair the files that fail, the way Steam's "Verify
//! integrity of game files" does.
//!
//! **What the files are checked against.** A client zip already carries the
//! size and CRC-32 of every file in its central directory. Extraction records
//! that list in the client folder ([`FILES_MANIFEST`]), and a check reads every
//! file back and compares. A CRC-32 catches corruption (a bad sector, a copy
//! cut short, a file some other program rewrote); it is not a defence against
//! someone swapping files on purpose, and isn't meant as one. An install made
//! before the list existed has nothing trustworthy to be compared with — the
//! zip is deleted once it is extracted — so it has to be reinstalled once.
//!
//! **Repair** fetches only what is broken, when the server allows it: with
//! byte ranges, the zip's central directory and then each damaged file's own
//! bytes are read straight off the server ([`RangeReader`]). A server that
//! sends only the whole file (Stella's) can't be read from the middle, but it
//! can be read from the start and hung up on: the list also records where
//! each file sits in the zip, so a repair streams the zip only as far as the
//! last damaged file, inflating those as they go by ([`repair_from_stream`]),
//! and never stores the rest. A list from before positions were recorded is
//! repaired the same way, walking the zip's headers to find each file
//! ([`repair_by_scan`]). Only a zip that walk can't find its way through
//! falls back to downloading all of it (`download::download_and_repair`).
//! Either way a file is only ever replaced by the same file: its size and
//! CRC-32 in the zip being read must be the ones recorded at install. A zip
//! that has since been rebuilt is a different client, and the answer to that
//! is an update or a reinstall, not a mix of two builds.

// ── Reading a zip off the server, a range at a time ─────────────────────────

/// A remote file as `Read + Seek`, fetched a range at a time, so the zip
/// reader can open a zip on a server and read only the parts it needs: the
/// central directory at the end, then the damaged files' own bytes.
///
/// A few recent blocks are kept, since the zip reader goes back and forth
/// between the central directory at the end and each file's header. Reading
/// straight on from the end of the block just read doubles the next fetch, up
/// to [`RangeReader::MAX_FETCH`], so a large file streams in a few dozen
/// requests rather than thousands. A jump elsewhere fetches the aligned block
/// around it: the zip reader finds the end of the archive by stepping
/// backwards from the last byte, and a fetch starting at each step would miss
/// on every one of them.
