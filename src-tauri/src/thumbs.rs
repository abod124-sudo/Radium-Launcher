//! Downscaled, disk-cached thumbnails for the remote images the UI shows.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Vanilla serves room and profile images from `/images/<name>` as the file the
//! game uploaded, at whatever size it was captured. Measured 2026-09-09, a
//! typical room image is a **2560x1440 PNG, 3.2 MB on the wire and 14 MB once
//! the webview decodes it** — to be drawn in a card about 200 px wide. A page of
//! twelve room cards is therefore ~35 MB of downloads and well over a hundred
//! megabytes of decoded bitmap, which is most of what made opening Rooms feel
//! like it was loading the entire network.
//!
//! It is also paid *every* time. Those responses carry no `Cache-Control`, no
//! `ETag` and no `Last-Modified`, and Cloudflare reports `cf-cache-status:
//! DYNAMIC`, so the webview has nothing to revalidate against and re-downloads
//! all of it on every visit to the tab.
//!
//! Radium's images come from a resizing CDN and arrive small, but they get
//! nothing off disk either.
//!
//! So: fetch once, downscale to the width the UI actually asked for, keep the
//! result on disk, and serve it over a custom URI scheme so an `<img>` can point
//! straight at it. A room card goes from ~3 MB to ~20 KB, and the second visit
//! costs a file read.
//!
//! ## Reachable from the webview
//!
//! The scheme handler takes a URL out of page content, so it is an outbound
//! request the renderer chooses. [`host_allowed`] restricts it to the image
//! hosts the two networks actually use — without that, any injected markup in
//! the webview could aim this at an arbitrary host, including one on loopback.
